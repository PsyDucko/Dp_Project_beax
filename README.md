# IIT Mandi One App

A unified, all-in-one campus app built as part of the Design Practicum (DP) course by five students at **IIT Mandi**. The app is designed to centralize essential campus services — helping students, faculty, and guests easily navigate and access everything they need.

## Project Overview

IIT Mandi is a growing institution with two campuses and a complex layout. For newcomers and even long-time residents, finding services and accessing up-to-date information can be a challenge. **IIT Mandi One** is our solution — a digital companion to streamline campus life.

This app was developed from scratch using Flutter (frontend) and Firebase (backend), with real-time features and modular architecture.
